#### PugLoot provides commands for assisting the master looter with distributing items in PUGs.
This addon does not automatically distribute loot to winners, but makes the process easier.
 
##### Commands
`/pugloot random [Some Item]`

Rolls between 1 and the number of raid members and informs the raid of which member was chosen.

The list of members is sorted alphabetically to produce consistent results across group rearrangements.

 

`/pugloot start [Some Item]`

Begins an open roll for an item that lasts 15 seconds.  All valid rolls (1-100) are recorded until the roll period ends.

The member with the highest roll is announced along with a summary of all the rolls.  In the event of a tie, all members who rolled the highest number are listed.
